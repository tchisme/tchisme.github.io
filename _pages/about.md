## 🧑🏻About me 
Welcome! I’m Tung Cheuk Hin (Oscar), a passionate learner and graduate in Mathematics from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My academic interests lie in applied mathematics, data analysis, and investing, and I enjoy exploring how theoretical concepts translate into practical solutions. During my studies, I’ve engaged in projects involving mathematical modeling, programming, and quantitative analysis, including a capstone exploring competition in economic markets. This website showcases my academic work, projects, and areas of interest as I continue to grow in the fields of mathematics and applied research.

Outside of academics, I enjoy spending my leisure time exploring a variety of interests that help me stay balanced and inspired. I’m an avid reader, particularly of popular science and economics, and I enjoy following global tech and financial market trends. I also like playing chess and practicing mindfulness through walking or casual photography. Whether it's discovering new cafes, going on nature hikes, or learning something new online, I try to keep my free time enriching and refreshing.
