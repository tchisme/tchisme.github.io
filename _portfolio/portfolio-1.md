## Background
In this [Project](files/Capstone_Project.pdf), me and my group mate investigates how pricing strategies affect market share in a duopoly market, a structure where only two major firms dominate an industry. This project is specifically contextualized within Hong Kong, analyzing industries such as: 
- 🚌 Bus Transport (KMB and Citybus)
- ✈️ Airlines (Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong Airlines)

## 🧠Concepts and Knowledge Used
1. Economic Theory of Duopoly
- Assumes two firms, homogeneous goods, and competitive pricing.
- Considers market share as the key metric for dominance.

2. Dynamical Systems and ODEs
- Models the evolution of market share over time using differential equations.
- The system tracks how one company's pricing affects its own and its rival's market share.

3. Gaussian Distribution of Demand
- Assumes price–demand relationship follows a normal distribution curve.
- Captures how far a price is from the average influences how many customers a company attracts.

4. Numerical Simulation (MATLAB)
- Solves the differential equations under different pricing scenarios.

## 🧩Limitations
1. Does not model substitutes like MTR in the bus example.

2. Cannot predict absolute price levels that yield max market share — only relative dynamics.



## 📈 Key Insights and Results
A company should adopt **aggressive pricing** when the market is **unstable** and it seeks dominance.

When the market is **stable**, **mirroring the rival's pricing strategy** helps maximize sustainable market share.

**Consumer inertia** plays a big role — customers stick with familiar options when companies behave similarly.
